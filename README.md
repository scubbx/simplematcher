This CouchApp (http://couchapp.org/page/index) is a canonical implementation of a web application to perform a comparative analysis of OSM POIs with a random set of points.

## Requirements

* CouchDB database (http://couchdb.apache.org)
* GeoCouch extension with polygon search capability (https://github.com/vmx/geocouch/tree/couchdbgeom)
* The database has to contain OSM data generated by OSMCouch (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMCouch)
